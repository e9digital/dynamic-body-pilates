<p class="serif">She's 57, and a mother of three. She has hip and back pain, and a bad rotator cuff. She figured she was too out of shape to get in shape.</p>

<p>We're all searching for a personal breakthrough in mobility, fitness, and bodily ease. Their issues are too specific or compounded for rote, cookie-cutter moves. They need to rebuild their movement – from the ground up.<br/><br/> 

They found the answer with Dynamic Body Pilates.<br/><br/>  

Dynamic Body Pilates is custom Pilates for your body. Influenced by Alexander Technique, FeldenkraisTM,...and dozens of other movement modalities, we create a program specifically for you. We'll teach you where movements should originate from, and introduce you to muscles you didn't know existed, making you more fit and in control.

As your awareness increases, so do your ease and grace. Pain recedes. And you feel like the person you forgot you could be.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is the paragraph text link style.</span> Nor are we interested in working with you if you are passionless or unsure about your brand and what you want to convey.
